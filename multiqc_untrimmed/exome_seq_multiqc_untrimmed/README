The workflow for running FastQC and MultiQC on the Exome sequencing samples:

First, all of the raw data is housed under **/data/Wilson_Lab/placenta/valleywise_raw_data/exome**. Since only one DNA sample was taken per placenta, we will only have 40 files. 

We can run the script **make_fastq_list.sh** to make a list of all exome seq fastq files, **fastq_list.txt**.

With this list, we can use **make_fastqc_swarm.sh** to build a swarm file, **fastqc.swarm** that runs FastQC on each sample, which can then be run as a swarm job.
The output FastQC files are found under the directory **fastqc_results**.

Once the FastQC results are available, we can run MultiQC using **run_multiqc.sh**.
Results can be found under the directory **multiqc_results**!
