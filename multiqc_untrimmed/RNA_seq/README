The workflow for running FastQC and MultiQC on the RNA sequencing samples:

First, all of the raw data is housed under /data/Wilson_Lab/placenta/valleywise_raw_data.
Quadrant 1 can be found under **/data/Wilson_Lab/placenta/valleywise_raw_data/RNAseq**.
Quandrants 2, 3, and 4 can be found under **/data/Wilson_Lab/placenta/valleywise_raw_data/valleywise_placenta_3samples**.

The fastq files for quadrants 2, 3, and 4 are unmerged, so in order to merge them we run the script **make_merge_swarm.sh**. 
This gets all the unmerged files into one swarm file, **merge_fastqs.swarm**, which can then be run as a swarm job to merge the files. 
The output merged files are found under the directory **merged_fastqs**.

Now that we have the fastq files properly merged, we can run the script **make_fastq_list.sh** to make a list of all RNA seq fastq files from each quadrant, **fastq_list.txt**.

With this list, we can use **make_fastqc_swarm.sh** to build a swarm file **fastqc.swarm** that runs FastQC on each sample, which can then be run as a swarm job.
The output FastQC files are found under the directory **fastqc_results**.

Once the FastQC results are available, we can run MultiQC using **run_multiqc.sh**.
Results can be found under the directory **multiqc_results**!
